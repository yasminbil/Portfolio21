        <p class="lead my-3">A case study for ClimateView, a startup who helps cities to collate climate information so
          that they can understand what challenges and solutions there are. The goal was to give ClimateView insights
          from our research on what high school students want in terms of being engaged and well-read about the climate
          challenges we face. </p>

          <p>Many people know that human beings affect the climate and great initiatives are often started to make
            things better. ClimateView wants to help through accelerating these initiatives.
            ‍
            Our assignment was to answer this problem statement: <em>“How can we design a service that generates local
              engagement amongst young people?”</em></p>
          <h4>More Context</h4>
          <p>This project was part of the course UX Process 1: Analysis and Strategy, at Nackademin’s UX Design
            Programme. It was a group project consisting of 5 members.</p>
          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <p>Finding the target group, conducting interviews, doing a thematic analysis, market intelligence mapping and
            quantitative research (surveys), developing a persona and user journey, Impact Mapping.</p>
          <h4>Target Group</h4>
          <p>High School Students (Gymnasium), ages 16-19.</p>
          <h4>Prototyping Tool</h4>
          <p>Figma.</p>
          <h4>Time Frame</h4>

          <dl>
            <dt>Stakeholder mapping and interviews</dt>
            <dd>We made a stakeholder map of people we were interested to hear from. We analysed how easy these
              stakeholders were to get hold of and also how much knowledge they could give us.

              We interviewed not only high school students but also elementary school pupils to make sure we didn’t miss
              out on relevant knowledge. We made the decision to focus on high school students as they make more
              independent decisions. We also included teachers and a journalist to get their perspectives.

              We transcribed the interviews and highlighted words, sentences and paragraphs we wanted to further
              investigate in a thematic analysis. </dd>

          <h3>Survey</h3>
          <dl>
            <dd>We used a survey to get more insight into areas we hadn’t covered in our qualitative research, and to
              confirm some of the insights from the interviews.</dd>

          <h3>Our Conclusion: Use the Teachers</h3>
          <dl>
            <dd>During our interviews we noticed that schools are an important channel for climate information. The
              curriculum states that environmental aspects should be part of school but it doesn’t state how. The
              teachers can reach many students but may need more relevant material as a help.
              ‍
              One solution to engaging young people could be to make the data and material accessible and useful to
              teachers. Below we've made a proto-persona of a teacher. To become a persona to base decisions on it would
              need more research.</dd>

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Group Dynamics</dt>
            <dd>With such a big and complex problem it was hard to navigate and keep motivated at times. Our group
              introduced activities such as check ins/outs, to understand each other better and make sure we are working
              towards the same goal.</dd>
            <dt>Confirm insights instead of broadening knowledge</dt>
            <dd>It seemed like our questions never ended, we just wanted to know more. When sending out the survey we
              therefore broadened our knowledge about the target group even more, but in hindsight I feel like we
              should’ve focused more on confirming our qualitative research with the surveys instead.</dd>
            <dt>Having more regular contact with client</dt>
            <dd>It would’ve been great if we had booked in frequent meetings with our client to show our progress and
              see if we were on the right track according to them.</dd>
