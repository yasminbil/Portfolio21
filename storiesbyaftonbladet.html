          <p>How do you get the younger generation, who is already fed with lots of information, to notice your product?
            How do you get them to read the news on your app when you compete with so many other things that are on
            their minds?</p>
          <h4>More Context</h4>
          <p>This project was part of a UX introduction course at Nackademin’s UX Design Programme. It was a group
            project consisting of 4 members.</p>
          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <p>Analyzing interviews, doing a competitive analysis, brainstorming together with the group, visual design in
            Figma.</p>
          <h4>Target Group</h4>
          <p>Generation Z, more specifically ages 17 to 23.</p>

          <p>Figma.</p>

            <dt>Interviews and Competitive Analysis</dt>
            <dd>We started off by getting to know our target audience through interviews while also conducting a
              competitive analysis of popular apps among Gen Z and other news apps.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3>Define</h3>
          <h5>Insights from the interviews</h5>
          <dl>
            <dt>Thematic Analysis</dt>
            <dd>After coding the interviews and sorting wordings into appropriate themes with post-its, we got an
              understanding of the needs and the frustrations of Gen Z when consuming news today.</dd>
            <dt>Wants & Needs</dt>
            <dd>
              <ul>
                <li>To be engaged in environmental, political and societal matters</li>
                <li>To be able to discuss with friends</li>

                <li>The language is hard</li>

          <h5>Defining the Problem</h5>
          <dl>
            <dt>Persona</dt>
            <dd>Following the thematic analysis, a persona with the same needs and frustrations as previously mentioned
              was discussed and given a name, age and a face.</dd>
            <dt>User Story</dt>
            <dd>We discussed a User Story for the persona and ended up with:
              ‍
              <em>“As a Gen Z in my early 20’s, I want to, despite the fact that I’m not that informed on a specific
                topic, understand current matters.”</em>
            </dd>
            <dt>How might we</dt>
            <dd>Based on the User Story this HMW was constructed:
              ‍
              <em>"How Might We inspire Gen Z to acquaint themselves with news they have little to no prior knowledge
                about?ormed on a specific topic, understand current matters.”</em>
            </dd>

            <dt>Ideation</dt>
            <dd>After coding the interviews and sorting wordings into appropriate themes with post-its, we got an

          <h3>Deliver</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Design development</dt>
            <dd>After the brainstorming session we made some sketches and wireframes to ensure we were all on the same
              page. With our insights from the interviews and the competitive analysis, we noticed Gen Z turns to
              Instagram and TikTok a lot. We wanted to explore using a format that they are already used to, to
              encourage confident usage. </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>The Concept</dt>
            <dd>Our idea was to let the user scroll in a feed just like Instagram, and be able to click on an
              image/article to know more. This would take the user to a full screen with visuals and simple text about
              the matter, for them to learn more - a bit like the Stories function on Instagram.</dd>

          <dt>Answering to their Frustrations</dt>
          <dd>Remember the frustrations Gen Z had? Messy feed, long articles with difficult language... Let's check out
            how we answered to them:</dd>
          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>Using full screen images/videos to keep it simple and avoid distractions.</li>
              <li>Storytelling properties where users can tap themselves further into the article.</li>
              <li>The article itself has visuals with simple and brief information, to keep the users’ attention.</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
          <dl>
            <dt>Moodboard</dt>
            <dd>Based on our insights we thought it was a good idea to deviate from the classic Aftonbladet style to
              create a totally different feel of the app for users who currently don’t prefer the current design of
              Aftonbladet’s app.
              ‍
              Our inspiration was the show Euphoria, which has a storyline about Gen Z. We wanted to use purple which
              stands for creativity and blue for stability.</dd>

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>The Tight Time Frame</dt>
            <dd>This was an intense week where I learned a lot and got to familiarise myself with the UX process. If
              there had been more time I would’ve wanted to dig deeper into every tool we used and explored even more
              tools like user journeys and a value proposition canvas.</dd>
            <dt>Testing the Design</dt>
            <dd>Unfortunately there was no time for testing the design on potential users. This would’ve given us
              valuable feedback to be able to go back to the drawing table and reiterate the design.</dd>
            <dt>Incorporating Advertisement</dt>
            <dd>There’s still an importance for Aftonbladet to run ads as this is partly how they are financed. To be
              able to show them that we had thought of the business side of things by incorporating a slide with an ad
              into the home page or during the full screen story would’ve been a nice touch.</dd>
