        <h1 class="display-4 fst-italic">Workshop - Idea Development</h1>
        <p class="lead my-3">In the course UX Process 1, we held a workshop for our fellow classmates who had already
          ideated on solutions to their problem in a previous workshop. We wanted them to now choose and develop an idea
          that would solve a problem they had defined.</p>

          <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Problem</h2>
          <p>With a complex problem statement it can be challenging for a group to choose the right solution
            unanimously. This can be facilitated by bringing the group together to brainstorm.</p>
          <h4>More Context</h4>
          <p>This workshop was part of the course UX Process 1: Analysis and Strategy at Nackademin’s UX Design
            Programme. It was a chance to work on our workshop facilitation skills on our fellow classmates. The
            workshop was held online due to Covid-19.</p>
          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <p>Making and designing the workshop structure. Facilitating a group of 5 students.</p>
          <h4>Programme used</h4>
          <p>Miro.</p>
          <h4>Time Frame</h4>
          <p>2 hours workshop time.</p>

          <h2>The Workshop Playfield</h2>
          <p>By gathering information about the team we were to assist, and where they got to in their last workshop, we
            were able to set up the workshop structure in advance.</p>
          <div>
            <div class="bd-example">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="WSplayfield.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>The Parking Lot</h2>
          <p>Just before we got into the actual workshop, we introduced the parking lot for all the ideas the team would
            come up with that didn’t necessarily fit into to the scope of this workshop.</p>
          <div>
            <div class="bd-example">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="WSparking.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Intro and Check In</h2>
          <p>An intro was done to make sure the team knew the agenda and the rules for the workshop (like turning the
            camera on etc).

            We used the check in to be able to understand where the team felt like they were at, getting a bit of
            insight into their status. They were asked to place a wagon on a rollercoaster to visualize their feelings.
          </p>
          <div>

            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Recap from Previous Workshop</h2>
          <p>We spent a few minutes walking the team through a recap of what the result was from their previous
            workshop, making sure they’re happy to continue with the ideas that had the most votes.</p>
          <div>
            <div class="bd-example">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="WSrecap.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Choosing the Winner Idea</h2>
          <p>To validate which idea to move on with we let the team place the ideas on an impact/effort diagram and
            choose one winner idea (ideally an idea that’s been placed in the above left corner).</p>
          <div>
            <div class="bd-example">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="WSwinner.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Start Developing the Idea</h2>
          <p>We wanted the team to brainstorm on solutions for the idea. This was done in two iterations where they dot
            voted on the one they wanted to dig deeper with.</p>
          <div>
            <div class="bd-example">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="WSdevelop.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Summary, Next Steps and Check Out</h2>
          <p>Once the team had developed their idea, we summarized what they had come up with and suggested next steps
            that they could do as a team.

            If there’s a check in there’s a check out! We wanted the team to reflect on if they felt differently to what
            they felt at the beginning of the workshop.</p>
          <div>
            <div class="bd-example">

            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Getting Feedback Right Away
          </h2>
          <p>Before letting the group go, we let them write down some feedback they had for us.</p>
          <div>
            <div class="bd-example">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="WSfeedback.jpg">
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Online vs Physical Workshop</dt>
            <dd>It worked pretty well doing the workshop in Miro. We tried to figure out a smooth way to get the team to
              draw their ideas, either in a drawing programme or on physical paper instead of writing it down, but we
              figured the logistics for that could be time consuming. In hindsight we could’ve taken the risk; we did
              end up finishing earlier than anticipated anyway.</dd>
            <dt>Anchoring Decisions to the Persona</dt>
            <dd>One set of feedback we got was about their persona; how the team didn’t feel like they had based their
              ideas on their persona’s wants and needs. In the future I would like to ask for a copy of the persona and
              paste it into the workshop field and continuously remind them about it throughout the workshop.</dd>
